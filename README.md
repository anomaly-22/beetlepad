## Beetlepad
Beetepad is a macropad I created to help me with art. It has 12 keys and an OLED display that displays a idling beetle. It also has a beetle on the case cause I like them

In the future (once I get better at coding) I want to make the keys swappable so there's two buttons above the screen that can be used to switch the key layout

Made in Fusion 360. The top and bottom of the case are screwed together. This is also my first time importing DXF files for the holes and beetle on the top and I feel like I'll use it in the future to add things on my team's FTC robot :>

## PCB
